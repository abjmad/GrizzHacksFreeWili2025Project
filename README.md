## Inspiration
We got our inspiration from a simon says Free-WilI game where you press a button when prompted.
## What it does
Our game isa reaction based game, where you have to press the color displayed on the Free-WilI screen. The game will start with the LEDs displaying different colors, which is the countdown. Then, the LEDs will display a blue color where each LED will turn off after 10/7 until all LEDs are off, which is when the game ends. During the timer, the screen will display the color of the button the player presses, which is randomized after each button is pressed. When the game ends, the LEDs will display the player's score in binary code (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64).
## How we built it
We built it using python, C++, WSL, terminal, and Free-WilI.
## Challenges we ran into
Poor file naming conventions, causing errors due to misunderstanding what files go where.
Documentation of Free-WilI.
Coding in C++ for the first time, causing problems with learning syntax.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting the LEDs to properly work with the countdown and timer.
Getting the game to run again after running it one time.
## What we learned
How to work with a Free-WilI device and how to implement different codes into the device.
## What's next for Free-WilI Reaction Game!
Adding sound, a menu (maybe), and multiplayer.
